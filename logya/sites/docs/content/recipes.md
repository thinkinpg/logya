## Conditional Comments in Documents

Add a document header field `comments` and give it a value to enable
comments for a document:

    comments: 1

If you don't want comments on particular posts just omit the `comments`
header field or don't give it a value:

    comments:

In the document's template check for the value of the `comments` field
and add the code for an external comment systems like Disqus or Facebook
comments:

    {% if comments %}
        comments go here
    {% endif %}

The above code checks that the `comments` variable exists and has a
value, so this will also show the comments section if you enter a value
of 0 in the document header.

## Setting all content files in directory to noindex

To set all files in a given directory recursively so that they still
have a page generated but don't appear in any index, you can use this
command in Bash:

    find content/lesson/ -type f -exec perl -i -pe "BEGIN{undef $/;} s/\-\-\-\n/---\nnoindex: 1\n/s" {} \;
